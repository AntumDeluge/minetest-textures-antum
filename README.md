This is the texture pack for the Antum game for Minetest/Freeminer. For clients, place the folder labelled "antum" into the client's textures directory. Normally this is located in a user's home directory. For example, on UNIX/Linux systems, the directory would be located in '/home/<username>/.minetest/textures'. Then, from the client, select the "Textures" tab & select "antum". For servers, place the folder in the Minetest standard textures directory, on Linux this is usually '/usr/share/minetest/textures'.
